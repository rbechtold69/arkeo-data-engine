## Competitive Landscape Summary

### Price Comparison (per 1M standard requests)

| Provider | Type | Cost/1M Requests | Free Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pocket Network** | Decentralized | ~$0.001 (wholesale) | ✅ Free public RPCs |
| **GetBlock** | Centralized | ~$0.78 | ✅ 50K CU/day |
| **Chainstack** | Centralized | ~$2.45 | ✅ 3M RU/month |
| **Infura** | Centralized | ~$5.00 | ✅ 3M req/month |
| **QuickNode** | Centralized | ~$5-7.50 | ✅ 50M credits/month |
| **Alchemy** | Centralized | ~$10.00* | ✅ 30M CU/month |
| **Lava Network** | Decentralized | Token-based | ✅ Public RPCs |
| **Arkeo** | Decentralized | **TBD** | **TBD** |

*\* Alchemy's CU-based pricing makes direct comparison difficult; complex calls cost more.*

### Key Market Gaps Arkeo Can Fill

1. **🔴 Thorchain RPC** — Zero providers (centralized or decentralized) currently offer Thorchain
2. **🟡 Cosmos Ecosystem** — Only GetBlock and POKT/Lava have partial support; centralized providers largely ignore Cosmos
3. **🟢 Permissionless Access** — Only POKT offers truly no-signup access; all centralized require accounts
4. **🟢 Crypto-Native Billing** — Only Chainstack/GetBlock accept crypto among centralized; decentralized are token-native
5. **🟢 Provider Marketplace** — No competitor has an open marketplace where providers compete on price and quality
6. **🟢 Smart Contract SLAs** — No competitor offers on-chain, enforceable service agreements

### Arkeo's Positioning

Arkeo sits at the intersection of:
- **Decentralized infrastructure** (like POKT/Lava) — censorship-resistant, no single point of failure
- **Marketplace dynamics** (unique) — providers compete, driving quality up and prices down
- **Cosmos-native** (unique advantage) — built for the ecosystem that centralized providers ignore
- **Thorchain support** (exclusive) — the only provider in the market
